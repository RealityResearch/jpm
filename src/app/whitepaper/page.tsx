          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            J.P. Moregain represents a paradigm shift in memecoin asset management through the strategic use of distributed memetic value creation. As the premier "corporate meme," <strong>JPM</strong> leverages game-theory incentive alignment to deliver shareholder value through <strong>coordinated community action</strong>, <strong>transparent capital allocation</strong>, and <strong>strategic market interventions</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Our mission transcends traditional memecoin speculation by establishing a new asset class: the <em>Corporate Parody Token (CPT)</em>. Through rigorous application of pseudo-institutional frameworks, milestone-driven capital deployment, and community-governed actions, <strong>JPM</strong> creates sustainable value while simultaneously exposing the absurdist nature of both traditional finance and crypto markets. We achieve this through our proprietary <strong>Three Pillar Strategy: Aligned Incentives, Transparent Metrics, and Weaponized Irony</strong>. The result is a financial instrument that performs the dual function of wealth creation and cultural critique - a memecoin that understands itself as performance art.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Traditional memecoins suffer from a fundamental <strong>principal-agent problem</strong> wherein creator incentives diverge from holder interests post-launch. <strong>JPM</strong> resolves this through our <em>Revenue-Aligned Creator Compensation (RACC)</em> model, whereby creator remuneration directly correlates with milestone achievement and community-approved capital allocation strategies.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">This alignment manifests through three core mechanisms:</p>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 pl-4">
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Milestone-Based Value Unlocks</strong>: Creator compensation gates behind specific market capitalization thresholds, ensuring sustained commitment to price appreciation and ecosystem development. Unlike traditional vesting schedules, our dynamic milestone system requires active community engagement and viral marketing execution.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Community Veto Power</strong>: All major capital allocation decisions exceeding $10,000 require shareholder approval through our proprietary browser-based voting infrastructure. This creates a checks-and-balances system reminiscent of corporate governance while maintaining the anarchic spirit of decentralized finance.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Transparent Expense Reporting</strong>: Every creator withdrawal, marketing expenditure, and operational cost appears on our public dashboard instantly. This radical transparency transforms the typical memecoin "rug pull" narrative into a parody of quarterly earnings calls.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <strong>JPM</strong> applies classical game theory principles to solve the memecoin prisoner's dilemma. Traditional memecoins incentivize early exits through fear-based selling pressure. Our framework creates positive-sum outcomes through coordinated collective action.

                <strong>The Stunt Coordination Mechanism</strong>: By publicly announcing and funding community-approved marketing stunts (plane banners over Wall Street, fake J.P. Morgan posters in financial districts, Times Square billboards declaring "The Real JPM Has Arrived"), we transform individual speculation into collective performance art. Each participant becomes both investor and actor in our ongoing production.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Voting as Commitment Device</strong>: Shareholder votes on proposed stunts serve as public commitment mechanisms. When 1,000 holders vote to fund a plane banner reading "Jamie Dimon Loves JPM Coin," they create social pressure for execution and participation. This transforms passive holding into active community building.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>The Transparency Paradox</strong>: By making all financial data public - including creator profits, marketing expenses, and treasury holdings - we create a prisoner's dilemma where <strong>transparency becomes the dominant strategy</strong>. Bad actors cannot hide, and good actors gain reputational capital.
